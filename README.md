PLCC Data Dashboard
===================

This repository contains the code for the Purple Line Corridor Coalition's interactive data dashboard built by [NCSG](http://smartgrowth.umd.edu)

The dashboard is designed to provide a simple interface for viewing data that pertains to the goals outlined in the PLCC community compact. It is used by planners, advocates, and citizens to keep track of how communities that lie along the purple line's intended route are changing as the line is built
